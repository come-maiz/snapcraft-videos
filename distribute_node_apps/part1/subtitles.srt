Snapcraft makes it easy to package and distribute your node applications to Linux users.

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:12,269
If you don't already have the snapcraft command, you'll need to install it. There's a link in the description below

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,008
First we need to check the application name is available in the store and register it for our use

4
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,209
If the name is taken don't worry just choose another one

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,840
Now we'll create a template snapcraft yaml which will edit to describe the application

6
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,720
Add in the metadata users will see when searching the store for your application

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,059
If you had to register a different name earlier be sure to use that here

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,079
Now, add a part to describe how your application is built.

9
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,790
We use the node.js plugin snapcraft knows how to handle nodejs applications

10
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,330
We'll start with devmode which means the application is unconfined. We can tighten that up later

11
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,749
Finally we add an app stanza to define the commands contained in the snap.

12
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,209
Thatâ€™s it. Now we can create the snap with the snapcraft command.

13
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,470
Install and test the unsigned package locally with snap install

14
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,730
And push to the store with snapcraft push

15
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:05,020
Great! Now you can tell your community to snap install your application

16
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,580
